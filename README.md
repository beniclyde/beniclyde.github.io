Project Page for BMI 6018 Final Project

This page is for my project on DNA and RNA manipulations and mutation discovery functions. BMI 6018, Fall 2017. 
Project walkthrough notebook should get you through the functions and explanations of their use and the module that were created for the project. Please email if you have any questions. Other notebooks have most of the code that is located in the modules, along with some experimental functions that I couldn't get working quire right. Thank you.
